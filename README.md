# Crime_against_women_analysis
This Project solely focused on the analysis of Crime against women in India during a certain time period and the data set which was avaible.
All the data is concluded whether it being the state with highest crimes against women or the state with least number of criminal cases against women.
By using scipy and different libraries I also projected the data in graph and pie-chart forms for easy viewing and helping the viewer in analyzing it more firmly.
